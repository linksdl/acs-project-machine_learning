### Learning outcomes

- Describe the difference between parametric and non-parametric approaches
- Apply k-nearest neighbour to a small dataset (without using KDtrees)


### Parametric methods
> Parametric approach: choose a parametrized function with a certain structure, and learn the parameters.

#### Non-parametric methods

#### K-nearest neighbour
An efficient way to identify points that are close.
**KD-trees**
